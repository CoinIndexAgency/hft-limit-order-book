# NodeJS orderbook

:star: Star me on GitHub â€” it motivates me a lot!

Improved matching engine written in Javascript (NodeJS)

## Features

- Standard price-time priority
- Supports both market and limit orders
- Supports order cancelling

## Installation

Install with npm:
```sh
npm install hft-limit-order-book --save
```
Install with yarn:
```sh
yarn add hft-limit-order-book
```

## Usage

To start using order book you need to import `OrderBook` and create new instance:

```js
import { OrderBook } from "hft-limit-order-book";

const lob = new OrderBook();
```

Then you be able to use next primary functions:

```js
lob.processLimitOrder(side: 'buy' | 'sell', orderID: string, size: number, price: number);

lob.processMarketOrder(side 'buy' | 'sell', size: number);

lob.cancelOrder(orderID: string);
```

## About primary functions

### ProcessLimitOrder

```js
// processLimitOrder places new order to the OrderBook
// Arguments:
//      side     - what do you want to do (ob.Sell or ob.Buy)
//      orderID  - unique order ID in depth
//      quantity - how much quantity you want to sell or buy
//      price    - no more expensive (or cheaper) this price
//      * to create new decimal number you should use decimal.New() func
//        read more at https://github.com/shopspring/decimal
// Return:
//      error   - not nil if quantity (or price) is less or equal 0. Or if order with given ID is exists
//      done    - not nil if your order produces ends of anoter order, this order will add to
//                the "done" slice. If your order have done too, it will be places to this array too
//      partial - not nil if your order has done but top order is not fully done. Or if your order is
//                partial done and placed to the orderbook without full quantity - partial will contain
//                your order with quantity to left
//      partialQuantityProcessed - if partial order is not nil this result contains processed quatity from partial order
processLimitOrder(side: 'buy' | 'sell', orderID: string, size: number, price: number);
```

For example:
```
processLimitOrder("sell", "uinqueID", 55, 100);

asks: 110 -> 5      110 -> 5
      100 -> 1      100 -> 56
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      90  -> 5
      80  -> 1      80  -> 1

done    - nil
partial - nil

```

```
processLimitOrder("buy", "uinqueID", 7, 120);

asks: 110 -> 5
      100 -> 1
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      120 -> 1
      80  -> 1      90  -> 5
                    80  -> 1

done    - 2 (or more orders)
partial - uinqueID order

```

```
processLimitOrder("buy", "uinqueID", 3, 120);

asks: 110 -> 5
      100 -> 1      110 -> 3
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      90  -> 5
      80  -> 1      80  -> 1

done    - 1 order with 100 price, (may be also few orders with 110 price) + uinqueID order
partial - 1 order with price 110

```

### ProcessMarketOrder

```js
// processMarketOrder immediately gets definite quantity from the order book with market price
// Arguments:
//      side     - what do you want to do (ob.Sell or ob.Buy)
//      quantity - how much quantity you want to sell or buy
//      * to create new decimal number you should use decimal.New() func
//        read more at https://github.com/shopspring/decimal
// Return:
//      error        - not nil if price is less or equal 0
//      done         - not nil if your market order produces ends of anoter orders, this order will add to
//                     the "done" slice
//      partial      - not nil if your order has done but top order is not fully done
//      partialQuantityProcessed - if partial order is not nil this result contains processed quatity from partial order
//      quantityLeft - more than zero if it is not enought orders to process all quantity
processMarketOrder(side: 'buy' | 'sell', size: number);
```

For example:
```
processMarketOrder('sell', 6);

asks: 110 -> 5      110 -> 5
      100 -> 1      100 -> 1
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      80 -> 1
      80  -> 2

done         - 2 (or more orders)
partial      - 1 order with price 80
quantityLeft - 0

```

```
processMarketOrder('buy', 10);

asks: 110 -> 5
      100 -> 1
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      90  -> 5
      80  -> 1      80  -> 1
                    
done         - 2 (or more orders)
partial      - nil
quantityLeft - 4

```

### CancelOrder

```js
// cancelOrder removes order with given ID from the order book
cancelOrder(orderID: string);
```

```
cancelOrder("myUinqueID-Sell-1-with-100")

asks: 110 -> 5
      100 -> 1      110 -> 5
--------------  ->  --------------
bids: 90  -> 5      90  -> 5
      80  -> 1      80  -> 1
                    
done         - 2 (or more orders)
partial      - nil
quantityLeft - 4

```
